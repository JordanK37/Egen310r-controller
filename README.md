# Egen310r-controller
This code is written as an app, as well as arduino code to make an RC car with 2 servos and 2 motors operational.In this project for MSU for Egen310r, we used a Adafruit Feather Bluefruit 32u4 which connects via Bluetooth to the board, from the app. The code is commented to make understanding it easier, and the app was made in Xcode for iphones.
